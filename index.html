            <p>Atal Bihari Vajpayee was an influential Indian politician and poet, serving three terms as India's 10th
                Prime Minister. A co-founder and senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he was the first
                non-Congress Prime Minister to complete a full term. His tenure saw significant events such as the 1998
                Pokhran-II nuclear tests and efforts to improve relations with Pakistan.</p>

            <p>Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a distinguished Indian Parliamentarian for over five decades, elected ten times
                to the Lok Sabha and twice to the Rajya Sabha. Representing the Lucknow constituency, he retired in 2009
                due to health issues. As a founding member of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), he served as its president
                from 1968 to 1972. The BJS merged into the Janata Party, winning the 1977 election, and Vajpayee became
                the Minister of External Affairs under Prime Minister Morarji Desai. After resigning in 1979, he
                co-founded the Bharatiya Janata Party in 1980, becoming its first president.</p>
